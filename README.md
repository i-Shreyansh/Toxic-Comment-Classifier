The goal of the toxic comment classifier project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify toxic comments in online conversations. Toxic comments are those that are hurtful, abusive, or harassing in nature, and they can cause harm to individuals and communities.

The project will involve collecting a large dataset of comments from various online platforms, annotating them to label toxic comments, and then using this dataset to train a neural network-based model to predict whether a new comment is toxic or not. The model will be evaluated on a separate test set to determine its accuracy and other performance metrics.

The toxic comment classifier can be used in a variety of applications, such as online content moderation, social media monitoring, and digital safety. It can help identify and remove harmful comments from online platforms, create a safer online environment, and protect users from harassment and abuse.
